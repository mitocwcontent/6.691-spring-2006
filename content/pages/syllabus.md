Course Description
------------------

This is a new subject about electric power systems, an old but still very important area. Students taking this subject should have some background in electric power systems (e.g. having taken [6.061](/courses/6-061-introduction-to-electric-power-systems-spring-2011/)) or a very good background in electric network theory with some controls and electromagnetics. We will get into some aspects of economics of an electric power system (to try to understand the deregulation and restructuring of the industry) so some background in Economics would be helpful. As the subject is new and the possible course content is vast, it is impossible to fix the syllabus; we will be doing different things each time. This year we can anticipate looking into DC distribution systems and perhaps discussing renewable sources. The calendar given below is a 'straw man' and can be expected to change.

There will be some exercises associated with this subject. Expect several problem sets during the term and perhaps two quizzes. There will be no final exam but a final project instead.

Textbook
--------

Background information and many of the problems are available from the textbook: Bergen, A., and V. Vittal. _Power Systems Analysis_. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1999. ISBN: 0136919901.
