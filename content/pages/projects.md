Each student is expected to study some aspect of electric power systems planning or operations, to write a brief report (comparable in scope to a professional society conference paper) and to present the work to the class. Time in the last few class sessions is reserved for these presentations. The project topics were negotiated with and agreed to by the instructor before work was begun. Projects could be individual or team efforts. Teams consist of two or three students.
