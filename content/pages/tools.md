The following MATLAB® scripts were provided to students in the course.

Sample Simulation Scripts
-------------------------

Simulation Subroutine ([M](/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-691-seminar-in-electric-power-systems-spring-2006/tools/sf.m))  
This is a function script that generates the derivatives of the state variables. It is called repeatedly by ode23 and so should be efficient.

Main Script ([M](/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-691-seminar-in-electric-power-systems-spring-2006/tools/fsim.m))  
This is the MATLAB® program that runs the simulation.
